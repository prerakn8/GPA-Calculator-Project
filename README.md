Developed by Prerak Naik, 2024.

This is a GPA Calculator developed by me, Prerak Naik, to solve the issue of no standardized GPA Calculator at my high school, for weighted and unweighted classes. It uses my school's
grading system. 

The application uses the python language, along with the modules pyautogui for mouse movement (and tooltips), customtkinter for all of the GUIs, tkinter for the messageboxes, and pillow for rendering images. 
The tooltips help with navigating the application, mainly with new users. The application has been designed in a "dark mode" color scheme, so that it is better on the eyes. The application has user input validation. 

If you would like to download and run the application, download the .ZIP, and extract all to a folder of your choice. After that, you can run the python file, but before running the file, please read the paragraph below.

Please note that the application does not come with these libraries. If they are not already installed, you will get an error trying to run the file. If they are not installed, they need to be installed in your python folder (ex. Python312, Python311) using pip. If you want to do this, go to the command prompt on your system, use "cd" to navigate to your python folder. Your path in the command prompt should look like this (Replace 'Python31x' with your version of Python installed: C://...Python31x/Scripts>. Once the path looks like that, enter the following line: "pip install pyautogui customtkinter tkinter pillow". The modules should begin installing in your system. Once that is, you should be able to use the application correctly. You can uninstall those modules by using the same command, but replace 'install' with 'uninstall.' I have the project this way to avoid using a single EXE as the final project, which will only work on Windows, preventing other users. This project was finished in 2024, and since then, my knowledge of programming has changed. If I had the knowledge at the time, I would have made this into a website. But it is good for now, with no further changes necessary, since customtkinter cannot be made into a flask based website. 

Users can input letter grades (ex. A, B, C). Users can get help by looking at the section titled "Need Help." They can also access a simple number calculator by clicking the side buttons. Users
can also input different grades, different types of classes, different classes. They can delete those classes if they want. 

This project was developed in 2024 for the FBLA NLC in Orlando. It is very reliable and simple to use. Anybody can use it!

If you think this is great, please look at my other projects on my Github page.
