Developed by Prerak Naik.

This is a GPA Calculator developed by me, Prerak Naik, to solve the issue of no standardized GPA Calculator at my high school, for weighted and unweighted classes. It uses my school's
grading system. 

The application uses the python language, along with pyautogui for mouse movement (and tooltips), customtkinter for all of the GUIs, tkinter for the messageboxes, and pillow for rendering images. 

Users can input letter grades (ex. A, B, C). Users can get help by looking at the section titled "Need Help." They can also access a simple number calculator by clicking the side buttons. 

This project was developed in 2024 for the FBLA NLC in Orlando. It is very reliable and simple to use. Anybody can use it!
